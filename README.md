# What makes a tower interesting to build?

#### What features of a physical scene make it interesting? In this project we explore both open-ended building behavior in kids, as well as adult ratings of pre-built towers. We find that ``interestingness`` is a surprisingly reliable measure between subjects, and that physical configurations that violate expectations are considered more interesting.
