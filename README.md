## What makes a tower interesting?
What features of a physical scene make it interesting? In this project we explore both open-ended building behavior in kids, as well as adult ratings of pre-built towers. We find that ``interestingness`` is a surprisingly reliable measure between subjects, and that physical configurations that violate expectations are considered more interesting.

## Project Overview:
_Where can I find things?_

The repo is divided into three main sections: 
1. `stimuli` where you can find scripts for generating or viewing the stimuli from the two experiments
2. `experiments` where you can find code used for running the two web-based rating tasks
3. `analysis` where you can find our scripts for analysis and results.

There are also two additional directories: `models` and `utils` which provide auxiliary support. 
We'll expand on each of these sections below:

1. `stimuli`: using [tdw_physics](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/tdw_physics) to procedurally generate towers

2. `experiments`:
